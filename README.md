This is the repository for the Dungeon Game from the Beginning Ruby Book Chapter 6.

Initial structure of the game as laid out in the book has been added. Would like to extend this to create something more like a true DnD game. Perhaps even deploy with a GUI on a rails site. 

To do:
1. Build out a full map. 
2. Flesh out character attributes including: health, inventory, abilities, actions
3. Create items that can be inspected, added to inventory, used
4. Add enemies with health, names, types, abilites, actions
5. Create structure for interactions between players and enemies
